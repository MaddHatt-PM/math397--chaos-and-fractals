___Def: Orbit___: Let $x_o \in \R$ be an an initial point and define the sequence x_n recursively by $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.  
$\quad$ Note: This sequence is called the orbit of $x_0$ under iteration of $f$.  
___Def: Fixed Point___: A point $x_0 \in \R$ is a fixed point of $f$ if $f(x_0) = x_0$.  
___Def: Periodic Orbit___: Suppose an orbit satisfies $x_0 \to x_1 \to \dots \to x_0$, then the orbit is periodic.  
___Def: Periodic Points___: The points of a periodic orbit that are in cycle.  
___Def: Pre-Periodic___: Suppose $x_0 \to x_1 \to x_k \to x_{k+1} \dots \to x_{n-1} \to x_k$, then the points $x_0 \to x_{k-1}$ are pre-periodic.

___Notation___: Let an iteratively defined function be defined as $\text{Let } x_0 \in \R, \text{then } x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.  
For shorthand we can use $f^n(x)$ where $n$ is the iteration count.
