### 4.3.1
Note: We are working in $\R^n$ space where $n$ will typically be $2$.  
Note: $x = \vec{x}$ for the sake of these notes.  
Note: Compacted means closed and bounded.  

___Def: Contraction___
A function $f:\R^n\to\R^n$ is a contraction if there is a real number $r \ni 0<r<1 \land |f(x) - f(y)| \le r|x-y|$ for all $x,y\in\R$.
