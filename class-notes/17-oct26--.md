Conjecture: If $S$ is a self-similar set composed of $N_r$ copies of itself when scaled by the factor $r$, then,
$$
\begin{aligned}
N_r &= \bigg(\frac{1}{r}\bigg)^\text{dim} \\[1.5em]
\log N_r &= \log \bigg(\frac{1}{r}\bigg)^\text{dim} \\[1.5em]
&= \text{dim} \log \bigg(\frac{1}{r}\bigg) \\[1.5em]
\text{dim} &= \frac{\log(N_r)}{\log{\big(\frac{1}{r}\big)}} \\[1.5em]
&= -\frac{\log(N_r)}{\log{\big(r\big)}}
\end{aligned}

## 5.2 Similarity dimension of an IFS
___Def 5.2.1 Similarity Dimension___:  
Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$ be a fixed IFS of similarities and let $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^m$ be a list of contraction ratios.  
Note: List of contraction ratios $\iff$ List of associated similarity ratios.  
We define $s$ as the similarity dimension.  
We define a function $\Phi:[0,\infin)\to\mathbb{R}$ such that,
$$
\Phi(s) = r_1^s + \dots + r_m^s.
$$
Note that $\Phi$ has the following properties:  
1. $\Phi(0) = m$  
2. $\Phi(s)$ is a decreasing function.  
3. $\lim_{s\to\infin}\Phi(s) = 0$.
4. $\Phi(s)$ is a continuous function.

By these properties and the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a unique value of $s$ such that $\Phi(s) = 1$.  

Suppose that $r$ is given and $r_i = r$ for each $i$. Then,
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_1^s + \dots + r_m^s &= r^s + \dots + r^s \\
&= m(r^s) \\
&=1. 
\end{aligned}\\
\therefore s = \frac{\log(m)}{\log\big(\frac{1}{r}\big)}
$$

Some fractal dimension equations are impossible to solve.  
It is okay to state the value $s$ can be approximated.
