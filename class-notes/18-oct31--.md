# Box Counting Dimension
We define $N_\epsilon(E)$ as the smallest number of $\epsilon$-mesh squares required to cover the object $E$.  
Note: $\epsilon$ is the closed 2D squares that comprise a 2D space where the value of epsilon is defined by a value.  
For example, define the object $E$ to be a squiggly curve through space.  
As $\lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+}$, the number of squares required to cover the object $E$ grows to infinity.  

Def: Box-Counting Dimensions: The box-counting dimension $\text{dim}(E)$ of a non-empty, bounded subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by,
$$
\text{dim}(E) = \lim_{\epsilon\to0^+} \frac{\log[N_\epsilon(E)]}{\log(\epsilon / 1)}
$$
